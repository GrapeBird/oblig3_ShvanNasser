# oblig3_ShvanNasser

First I created package in my github repositery and than uploaded a package with the program for oblig2. I made sure to
only keep the most important files in the package before uploading to github. 

Than I downlaoded github desktop and cloned the package. 

After that I went to actions in github repository and downlaoded the github workflow "python application" that I
used to settup my automated github action for my Pythong file. 

Than I checked if the workflow worked properly by checking actions and testing my code and than comitting it. Than I
went back to actions to see if it run the test and gave me a result of red for somthing went wrong or green for all the
tests runned properly. 

Than I made sure this github was public, copied the link in inkognito to see it works without being logged in. And than
I put it in a txt file and delivered it on the Hiof page with a comment with the link aswell incase the txt file would
have issues being opened.
